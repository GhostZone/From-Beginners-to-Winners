Hi Everyone! 
If you have a project in mind that you would like us to display on our GitHub page please 
create guidelines of how to do the project. 
Guidelines help the members get an idea of how to do the project. 
For example, in order to make a calendar in Javascript, please do the following: create variables, a loop and etc.
Also, to post a suggestion on here, the member must create a pull request.
Thank you.
