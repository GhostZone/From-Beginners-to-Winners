#First project: HTML Skeleton Challenge
This is the place where we will all brainstorm ideas to create our very first challenge using HTML.

Dont' know where to start? Learn about Github and HTML as well. 
 
HTML Resources:
1) SOloLearn HTML Course
2) Codecademy HTML/CSS Course
3) W3SChools HTML Resource
4) HTML Tutorial YouTube Videos and much more!


Note: We will be creating other challenges and/or projects using other programming languages in the future.
Everyone here can make suggestions to our Collaborators to this project and they will update it.
Am looking forward to everyone's wonderful ideas.
