Hello Collaborators of our project!
Now that we have the HTML skeleton challenge on our repository,
the next step is to help create the JavaScript challenge.
Also, let's either find a tutorial or create a tutorial of how to update a forked repository. 
Please put ideas on this repository. I recommend posting them on the master branch so everyone can see it.
If you have any questions, please ask me.
Thank you.

Have fun coding away!
